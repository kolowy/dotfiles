Master Wq and the Windows developer

Master Wq was addressing some Vim novices. After his lecture on the many
virtues of Vim, he asked if there were any questions. A young man raised his
hand.

“Master, by what means might one filter for the second column of a plaintext
table for all rows that contain the string ‘tcp’?”

Master Wq said nothing, turned to the whiteboard behind him, and wrote:

    :%!awk '/tcp/{print $2}'

There was a murmur of approval from the other students.

“But I develop on Windows … ” the student stammered.

Master Wq turned again, erased the command, and wrote:

    :v/tcp/d :v/^\s*\S\+\s\+\(\S\+\).*/d :%s//\1/

“What! That is far too complex for such a simple task!” cried the student.

Master Wq turned again, erased the command, and wrote:

    Microsoft Excel

At once, the student was enlightened.
